# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
A daily planner that can be used to create a work-day schedule. The current day is displayed at the top of the page. Clicking on a timeblock allows you to edit that task. Save your changes by clicking the corresponding save button on the right. Timeblocks are color-coded to indicate if they are in the past, present, future, or being edited. All tasks are saved in local storage. Timeblocks and current day are audited every minute, and all tasks are cleared from timeblocks and local storage when a new day begins.
